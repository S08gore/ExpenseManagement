# Expense Management System

## Objective
Develop an Expense Management System using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** for the backend, and **Flutter** (or any modern frontend framework like **Vue.js**, **Angular.js**, or **Flutter**) for the frontend. The system should allow users to log their daily expenses, categorize them, and view their spending history.

## Technical Objective
Create a secure, scalable, and responsive web application with a well-structured database schema and clean, maintainable code.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Frontend:** Flutter (or any modern frontend framework)
- **Authentication:** JWT for secure user authentication

## Features

### User Authentication
- Secure user registration and login using JWT.
- Implement role-based access control (e.g., User, Admin).

### Expense Logging
- Users can log expenses by specifying the amount, category (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment), and a brief description.
- Allow users to set a date for each expense.

### Expense Categories
- Users can create, edit, and delete custom categories.
- Display expenses categorized by user-defined and default categories.

### Expense History
- Allow users to view their expense history, with filters for date ranges and categories.
- Provide a summary of total expenses by category and date.

### Role-Based Access Control
- Admins should have permissions to manage users, including viewing all user activities and expenses.
- Implement CRUD operations for managing categories and users.

### Extras (Bonus Points)
- Implement notifications for users to remind them to log expenses.
- Include form validation for expense logging.
- Add data visualization (e.g., charts) to represent spending patterns.
- Kudos if you implement the backend in TypeScript.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Effective and secure user authentication with role-based access control.
- Implementation of expense logging and categorization features.
- Clean and intuitive display of expense history and summaries.
- Bonus points for implementing additional features and extras.

## Submission Guidelines
Candidates must submit their application through **Bitbucket**. The deadline for submission is **Monday, September 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM**.

### Instructions
1. Create a user account on **Bitbucket**.
2. Clone the repository using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://phirlikar@bitbucket.org/sambuq-recruitment/intern_mock_test.git```
3. Create a new branch from the master branch. Name the branch as follows:
`WIT_<LASTNAME>_<FIRSTNAME>_<BRANCH_CODE>_<SEMESTER>`
   
      Example: WIT_KOLHI_VIRAT_CSE_6
   
      - List of BRANCH_CODE:
        - Computer Science Engineering - CSE
        - Information Technology - IT
        - Electronics and Computer Engineering - ECE
        - Electronics and Telecommunication - ENTC
        - Mechanical and Automation Engineering - MECH
        - Civil Engineering - CIVIL
        - Other - OTHR
     
5. The backend code will be submitted in the `src/back_end` folder.
6. The frontend code will be submitted in the `src/front_end` folder.
7. Do not commit any system-generated files in the repo.
8. Upload your latest resume in the `resume` folder.

**PLEASE NOTE:**

1. This project is designed to assess your technical skills and understanding of the requirements.
2. Focus on code quality, correctness, database design, and project structure. These aspects will carry more weight than the completeness of the assignment.
3. The UI should be clean, minimalistic, and responsive. Overemphasis on UI design will not earn extra marks.


**GOOD LUCK! ðŸš€**
