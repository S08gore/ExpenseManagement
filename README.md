The system should allow users to log their daily expenses, categorize them, and view their spending history.

1. This project is designed to assess your technical skills and understanding of the requirements.
2. Focus on code quality, correctness, database design, and project structure. These aspects will carry more weight than the completeness of the assignment.
3. The UI should be clean, minimalistic, and responsive. Overemphasis on UI design will not earn extra marks.
